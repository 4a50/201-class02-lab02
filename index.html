                <p>Well hello! My name is JP Jones. JP is short for Jonathan Paul.
                    I got this nickname because the last place I worked had 6 people named Jon!
                    One person was the lucky one and got to keep Jon. The rest of us got nicknames.
                    So it stuck, and here I am. I am a shade shy of 40, just retired out of the Navy,
                    and I really love Ghostbusters! Oh, and am a huge fanboy of the StarFox games. I used to be a
                    submariner,
                    I was an Assistant Navigator, responsible for the operational planning and safe navigation of the
                    ship.
                    Basically, getting from point ‘A’ to point ‘B’ and completing all our requirements, and above all
                    safely.
                    Seeing how navigating submarines doesn’t translate to well outside of the submarine force, it was
                    time to
                    change careers. I have always loved to program computers. Been doing it as a hobby since my mother
                    brought
                    home an IBM XT. I love to learn and am interested in almost anything people are to show me. I do
                    have an
                    associate degree in Technical Studies, as well as a ton of management experience, was in the Navy
                    for 20
                    years. Some goals that I am striving for, is to become a paid Software Developer. In 20 years, I
                    would like
                    to buy a patch of land and build a house on it, and perhaps pick up a Tesla along the way.
